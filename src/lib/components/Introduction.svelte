      A philosophical conversation over a fancy dinner, a comforting pep-talk
      during a walk in the park, or a long overdue reunion with high school friends:
      life is full of <strong>memorable moments</strong> with people that matter to you. Such
      interactions can easily be taken for granted, while it may be difficult or
      daunting to <strong>show your gratitude</strong> with words or gifts.
      <br><br>
      The <strong>Thank You Token</strong> is a concept I came up with to thank the important people in my life. I don't like
      gift-giving, as gifts often are unwanted and because of its environmental
      impact, and at the same time I find it difficult to convert my grateful
      feelings into words. The idea of a simple token of appreciation, holding
      <strong>little intrinsic value</strong> but all the <strong>more sentimental value</strong>, helps me in
      thanking close friends and family.</p

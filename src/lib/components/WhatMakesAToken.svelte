    A Thank You Token <strong>could be anything</strong>, but it typically has
    little intrinsic value and is preferably decorated with our logo to make it
    stand out. Ideally, <strong>you shouldn't need to buy something</strong> to
    make a token. Simple wooden blocks, small rocks, and even bottle caps work,
    as do DIY crafts such as origami and paper mache. Ultimately, the purpose of
    the token is the <strong>sentimental value</strong> it carries â€” the look should
    not matter too much.

    <p>
      A Thank You Token <strong>could be anything</strong>, but it typically has
      little intrinsic value and is preferably decorated (for example by painting)
      with our logo to make it stand out. Ideally,
      <strong>you shouldn't need to buy something</strong>
      to make a token. Simple wooden blocks, smooth rocks, and even bottle caps work,
      as do DIY crafts such as origami and paper mache. Ultimately, the purpose of the
      token is the <strong>sentimental value</strong> it carries - the look should not
      matter too much.

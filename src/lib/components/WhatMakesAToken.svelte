    A Thank You Token could be anything, but it typically has
    little intrinsic value and is preferably decorated with our logo to make it
    stand out. Ideally, you shouldn't need to buy something to
    make a token. Simple wooden blocks, small rocks, and even bottle caps work,
    as do DIY crafts such as origami and paper mache. Ultimately, the purpose of
    the token is the sentimental value it carries â€” the look should
    not matter too much.
